      "articleBody": "* American Airlines shares up; oil prices fall * Investors wait for Fed comment on rate hikes * Indexes: Dow down 0.8 pct, S&P down 0.4 pct, Nasdaq up 0.04 pct (Updates to afternoon) By Caroline Valetkevitch March 17 (Reuters) - The Dow and S&P 500 fell on Tuesday following a rally in the previous session, hit by declines in commodity-related shares and nervousness ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting. The Nasdaq was up slightly, boosted by shares of Apple , up 1.7 percent at $127.03, and Facebook, up 1.7 percent at $79.36. Among S&P 500 sectors, materials were the weakest with a 1.2 percent decline, led by Dupont, down 3.1 percent at $74.68. The energy sector was down 0.9 percent as oil prices fell further, pressured by concerns over a growing supply glut. Investors were anxious as the Federal Open Market Committee kicked off its meeting, to be followed by a statement from Chair Janet Yellen Wednesday afternoon. Investors hope the statement brings insight into the timing of an interest rate hike. \"People are waiting for the Fed to provide some degree of clarity going forward,\" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. Most economists expect the Fed to remove a pledge to be \"patient\" about raising interest rates from its statement, but O'Rourke said, \"if they're still on pace for a mid-year move, whatever language they use doesn't make a difference.\" At 2:37 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average fell 146.26 points, or 0.81 percent, to 17,831.16, the S&P 500 lost 9.11 points, or 0.44 percent, to 2,072.08 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.94 points, or 0.04 percent, to 4,931.45. While higher rates are a sign of strength in the U.S. economy, some investors question whether the economy is strong enough to handle the increased borrowing costs. Johnson & Johnson weighed most heavily on the S&P 500 with a 1.3 percent decline to $99.76. The benchmark S&P 500 index on Monday had seen its biggest percentage gain since Feb. 3. Last week, the Dow and S&P registered their third week of losses. Also boosting the Nasdaq, shares in American Airlines rose 7.6 percent to 54.02 after an announcement that it would join the S&P 500. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,828 to 1,191, for a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,516 issues fell and 1,166 advanced for a 1.30-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The S&P 500 was posting 17 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 77 new highs and 59 new lows. (Editing by W Simon and Nick Zieminski)"

Citigroup could not be immediately reached. JPMorgan Chase & Co agreed to pay about $100 million to settle the same lawsuit in January and UBS AG agreed to pay $135 million last week.

      "articleBody": "WASHINGTON, March 17 (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) lacks the skills to ensure that U.S. air carriers comply with rules governing the safe transport of hazardous materials including lithium batteries, a government watchdog said on Tuesday. A report released by the U.S. Transportation Department Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that the FAA lacks the training and guidance necessary to enforce Bush-era regulations that allow carriers to disclose hazardous material violations voluntarily, without incurring civil penalties. The OIG report surfaced a week after aircraft maker Boeing Co said that high-density packages of lithium batteries, like those used in cell phones and laptops, should not be carried on passenger planes because they pose fire risks. In 65 percent of hazardous material cases, OIG investigators found that the FAA did not obtain sufficient evidence to ensure that carriers fixed reported problems. The agency also has not sought to identify safety risks or trends involving hazardous materials and lacks the clarity to determine how carriers should meet the requirements. \"FAA does not have an adequate framework to carry out the (regulations) effectively,\" the 20-page report concluded. The inspector general's office said FAA officials agreed with nearly all of its recommendations. In a two-page FAA memo included with the report, the agency also said it has recently implemented strong internal controls to oversee compliance. \"This is a significant enhancement in the level of oversight and addresses many of the findings of this audit,\" the memo said. From 1991 to 2014, the OIG report said that lithium batteries were involved in over 70 aircraft incidents that involved extreme heat, smoke, fire or explosion in air cargo and passenger baggage. In 2010, a United Parcel Service Boeing 747-400 aircraft caught fire and crashed in Dubai, killing both pilots. The final accident report said the cause may have been improperly declared lithium batteries and other combustible materials, according to OIG investigators.

Cemex, burdened with a heavy debt load from expensive acquisitions before the 2008 financial crisis, has been focusing on reducing debt to regain an investment-grade rating. The company believes it can refinance $2.9 billion in bonds at a coupon of around 9 percent this year, according to a presentation to investors. Cemex had total debt of $16.29 billion at the end of 2014. \"There are some clouds, but we're sure next year will be better,\" Cemex Chief Executive Fernando Gonzalez told analysts in New York in a conference streamed online. \"We can deliver growth above the average ... we can increase our volumes significantly,\" he added. Gonzalez said he expected demand next year to grow above 6 percent in the United States and Spain, while in Mexico, Central America and South America, it should grow at more than 3 percent.

      "articleBody": "(Refiled to delete repetition of word \"corporate\" in second paragraph) * Beyond cloud software sales, SAP eyes second revenue stream * Sights set on corporate procurement, a $75 bln market, it says * Analysts say subscription fees can shore up cloud margins By Harro Ten Wolde HANOVER, Germany, March 17 (Reuters) - Business software maker SAP is betting its development of online corporate purchasing services for its multinational customers can boost revenue and profits as it shifts its core business onto the cloud. Steve Singh, head of SAP's recently created Business Network division for cloud-based procurement services, says that by making a dent in the several trillions of dollars in total which big companies spend each year on purchasing goods and services, his company stands to take in billions of fees. \"There is a $75 billion opportunity,\" Singh says of the overall market that SAP is targeting. Analysts also say subscription fees for providing such procurement and vendor management services could give SAP the buffer on margins it needs as it shifts to deliver more of its software from the cloud, a move that brings higher upfront costs on each sale than older localised software installations. By creating a network of preferred business-to-business suppliers for big-ticket material purchases, temporary staffing, hotels and travel, SAP says it can help its multinational customers rein in on huge amounts of spending. SAP is looking to take advantage both of its position as the world's leading supplier of corporate financial management software and the nearly $20 billion it has spent on making cloud-based business acquisitions in recent years. These include ecommerce specialist Ariba, contract staffing firm Fieldglass and staff travel and expenses manager Concur. It is now combining these to produce a single Business Network for procurement services. It's a market where Europe's largest software maker faces competition from traditional rivals such as Oracle, Salesforce and Microsoft but also from less obvious names like China's Alibaba, with its own vast supplier network, and smaller, but fast-growing companies like staff management software specialist Workday. But because SAP has a vast base of customers using its financial planning software and now specific applications for managing key purchasing functions, analysts say it has a headstart in trying to win a big chunk of this market. A PIECE OF THE ACTION The success of this strategy is vital to ensure operating margins well above 30 percent don't shrink too far as it seeks over the next five years to generate roughly half of all revenue from software services delivered from the cloud, analysts say. SAP told an investor meeting last month it expected the Business Network to produce a 30 percent compound annual growth rate through 2020. It generated more than $1 billion of SAP's total revenues of $18.7 billion (17.6 billion euros) last year. And this added revenue stream could mean the difference between hitting its five-year profit target goals, or suffering sinking margins with the rest of the cloud industry. By 2020 SAP is aiming for an underlying operating profit of 8-9 billion euros on revenue of 26-28 billlion euros. Reported operating profit in 2014 was 4.33 billion euros. What scares investors is that cloud industry norms on profit margins are far below SAP's current 30 plus percent levels. For while pure-play cloud software names have enjoyed rapid sales growth for years, most still struggle to turn a profit. More pessimistic analysts predict cloud margins to settle closer to computer services margins, at or around 10 percent. \"SAP has to offset lower cloud margins with a more profitable business and that is where the Business Network comes in,\" said Gregory Ramirez, a financial analyst with brokerage Bryan Garnier in Paris.

      "articleBody": "(Updates throughout with background, details from speech, comments from SIFMA's Hammerman) By Sarah N. Lynch WASHINGTON, March 17 (Reuters) - U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White said on Tuesday she supports crafting new rules to harmonize the differing standards that govern how retail brokers and asset managers offer investment advice. White's announcement, made at a Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association conference in Arizona, mark the first time she has articulated a position on the controversial subject since taking over the helm of the SEC in the spring of 2013. In her comments, White told the audience it was \"beyond time to act in this space\" and that drafting rules was the \"right thing to do,\" according to a person who witnessed the event. White did not offer many details on how such rules may look. But generally the rule would aim to harmonize disjointed standards of care between investment advisers, who must act in a client's best interest, and brokers, who are held to a lower \"suitability\" standard. Some academics and critics say these different legal standards may confuse investors and fuel conflicts, because brokers may be inclined to sell products that benefit their bottom lines even if they are not the best choice for their clients. White's comments could influence an already-raging debate in Washington over parallel rules that the U.S. Department of Labor is planning to release for brokers who advise clients on individual retirement accounts. The Labor Department's rules would aim to reduce conflicts of interest and ultimately cut back on the fees charged to investors by holding retail brokers to a higher \"fiduciary\" standard, meaning they would be required to put their client's financial interests first. The SEC and the Labor Department are each governed by different laws and are able to act independently of one another, but many of the same asset managers including Wells Fargo , Charles Schwab and Raymond James would be covered by both rule sets. Critics, including many Wall Street trade groups, have decried the Labor Department's actions, saying the SEC is the more expert regulator and should take the lead. Several years ago, industry groups forced the Labor Department to scrap a first draft of a proposed fiduciary rule after they complained it would limit investors' access to retirement investment products and severely curb brokers' compensation. The SEC, by contrast, has been studying the issue, but until White's comments Tuesday, the agency had not signaled whether it might proceed with its own rules. Last month, President Barack Obama waded into the debate in an effort to rally support for the Labor Department, which is expected to release a new draft in the near future. (Reporting by Sarah N.

      "articleBody": "* FTSEurofirst 300 ends down 0.7 pct after 7-1/2 yr high * Peugeot falls as car sales growth lower than sector * DAX underperforms as ZEW survey lower than expected By Atul Prakash LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - European shares retreated from a 7-1/2-year high on Tuesday, with PSA Peugeot Citroen leading automakers lower after the release of car sales data and a disappointing German economic sentiment survey. Germany's DAX, down 1.5 percent, underperformed the market after hitting a new record high on Monday. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index ended 0.7 percent lower at 1,583.85 points, after setting a multi-year high of 1,598.03. The STOXX Europe Automobiles and Parts index fell 2.5 percent, hit by a 5.9 percent fall in Peugeot after the automaker's vehicle sales rose less than the sector in February. \"The new car sales from Peugeot are disappointing. Peugeot underperformed the European auto market in February with an increase limited at 1.1 percent,\" a Paris-based trader said. Data from the Association of European Carmakers (ACEA) showed new car registrations in Europe rose 7 percent in the month of February, fuelled by double-digit sales growth in Italy and Spain. European shares fell further after the German ZEW think tank said its survey of economic sentiment increased to 54.8 in March from 53.0 in February, less than a Reuters forecast of 58.2. ZEW warned a lack of progress towards defusing the Greek and Ukraine crises was dampening sentiment. \"The ZEW survey reminds that the underlying story in Europe is still far from clear. There is plenty of risk in the region such as low inflation, a lack of coordinated reforms and uncertainty over Greece,\" Lorne Baring, managing director of B Capital Wealth Management, said. \"All of these could still give investors a scare in 2015.\" Investors also traded cautiously ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee's two-day meeting starting on Tuesday. The U.S. central bank is expected to release late on Wednesday its statement and projections, which will be scrutinised for hints about the timing of an interest rate hike. Some analysts stayed positive on the longer-term outlook. The FTSEurofirst 300 has risen about 15 percent this year as bond purchases from the European Central Banks drove yields on government debt to record lows, leading investors to seek higher returns in equities. \"European assets are in a powerful catch-up rally, which is not over,\" said Pascal Blanque, chief investment officer at Amundi, which has 850 billion euros ($902 billion) in assets under management. \"With the euro falling, the QE (quantitative easing) starting, the recent improvement in macro indicators, European assets are in a sweet spot. It could last for a while, as long as global growth remains above 3 percent.\" Greek banks rose 1.4 percent, helped by a 9 percent rise in Bank of Piraeus on expectations that the Greek debt crisis will eventually get resolved.

      "articleBody": "* Federal Reserve begins two-day policy meeting * Wall Street stocks decline; most European markets lower * Crude oil continues recent downtrend (Updates to midday trading) By Ryan Vlastelica NEW YORK, March 17 (Reuters) - Stocks mostly fell on Tuesday as the Federal Reserve opened a two-day policy meeting, which is being closely watched for signs of when the U.S. central bank will raise interest rates. Trading was volatile in other asset classes. Crude oil prices edged lower and remained on track for their eighth decline in the past nine sessions, but were well off lows of the day. The U.S. dollar index turned flat, rebounding off earlier weakness. The euro, which recently hit a 12-year low, rose against the dollar for a second straight session, though it was off its session peak. European equity markets retreated from gains built on the euro's decline, which cheapens the price of exports from the euro zone. London's market was an exception, and Asian markets ended higher. U.S. crude oil hit a six-year low of $42.63 a barrel before paring losses to trade down 0.2 percent, at $43.79. The recent weakness has come on oversupply and the possibility that a nuclear agreement with Iran could add to the glut. Brent crude fell 1.3 percent to $53.22 per barrel. Investors were awaiting the release of the Fed's policy statement on Wednesday afternoon. Many analysts expect the Fed to remove the word \"patient\" from its statement to describe its approach to raising rates later in the year. Doing so would put the Fed a step closer to its first rate hike since 2006. Economists polled by Reuters are almost evenly split on whether a rate increase will come in June or later in the year. Recent U.S. data, including Tuesday's on February housing starts, has fueled talk that the Fed will remain on hold as long as possible. \"A lot of today's decline is speculation on how the Fed will respond, along with the sense that (U.S.) growth is weak,\" said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 137.69 points, or 0.77 percent, to 17,839.73, the S&P 500 lost 9.54 points, or 0.46 percent, to 2,071.65, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.05 points, or 0.08 percent, to 4,925.46. The MSCI International ACWI price index slipped 0.2 percent while European shares ended 0.7 percent lower, a day after hitting a 7-1/2-year high. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 11/32 in price, pushing the yield down to 2.0594 percent. The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.0592, having earlier risen as much as 0.8 percent. Earlier this week, the euro dropped to a 12-year low of $1.0457. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was flat at 99.612. On Monday, the index posted its biggest drop in more than a month. Gold prices fell 0.4 percent while silver was down 0.4 percent. Copper lost 1 percent in its second straight daily decline.

      "articleBody": "NEW YORK, March 17 (Reuters) - Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's blockbuster IPO has been followed by a steady slide in its stock price, which options market players do not expect to abate, with nearly a fifth of its shares to be released for trading on Wednesday. The Chinese e-commerce giant's stock soared after it first went public in September, but the party didn't last. Trading just above $84 on Tuesday, the stock has dropped 29 percent from an all-time closing high of $119.15 in November on concerns about slowed growth in China and fake items on its website. With an additional 437 million shares set to be freed in a post-IPO lockup, there has been an increase in bearish sentiment as investors hedge against more losses, with some even believing the shares will soon fall below the original IPO price of $68. \"It's a subtle but important sign that investors are more fearful,\" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York, who is short Alibaba shares. Earlier this year, Chinese regulators sharply criticized the company for selling substandard, fake or banned products. The 180-day post-IPO lock-up period bars various insiders from selling their shares. Of the 437 million shares to be sold publicly, about 100 million will remain subject to trading restrictions that apply to employees until after the company reports results in May. Short interest in Alibaba's shares has risen to 57 million shares as of Feb. 27, up 30 percent since the beginning of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Alibaba's options have been busy heading into the lock-up's expiration. In the last two weeks, puts betting on the stock dipping below $80 by Friday were the most actively traded. Deep out-of-the money puts, with their strike price well below the current share price and set to expire in April, have also seen an uptick in activity. \"A lot of people who are long the stock from the beginning want to try to let it run and they may be buying way out-of-the money puts against it [as a hedge] instead of putting a stop order on their stock,\" said J.J. Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. Overall, open interest in Alibaba puts - usually used for bearish bets - has risen more quickly than open interest in calls this year, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert. The ratio of puts-to-calls is 0.75, about the highest it has been since the options were listed in September. In recent months, there has been a sharp spike in open interest for strikes below the IPO price. For example, open interest in put options betting on Alibaba shares dipping below $65 by July 17 has increased to more than 8,500 from less than 1,000 contracts at the beginning of February.

      "articleBody": "(Corrects Wood's title in headline) By Burt Helm NEW YORK, March 17 (Reuters) - Before headphones and speaker company Beats Electronics was sold to Apple for more than $3 billion, the company faced a crossroads: It had parted ways with partner Monster Electronics in 2012 and needed new manufacturing partners. Luke Wood, then the chief operating officer and now the company's president, found himself traveling to Hong Kong every six to eight weeks to negotiate deals with Asian suppliers. In the process, he fell in love with the city. \"Hong Kong has this raw entrepreneurial spirit,\" says Wood, who is based in Los Angeles. \"It's the gateway in and out of China, so there is this truly global, cosmopolitan set of people. There's a tremendous amount of optimism, a tremendous amount of energy.\" When Wood visits the city these days, here's his playlist: When he lands: \"I go straight to the hotel and try to take as many calls as possible before North America goes to sleep. After that, I go for a run on Bowen Road toward Happy Valley. It turns into a fitness trail with great views and no cars.\" Room with a view: The Upper House (Pacific Place, 88, Queensway). \"My favorite room is an Upper Suite, with a corner city view. The staff are incredibly warm, professional and down-to-earth.\" Quiet spot for meetings: The members-only China Club (13 F -14 F 2A Des Voeux Rd. C) has dim sum and a 1930s Hong Kong feel. Get a private room for smaller meetings or book the library for bigger ones. Dinner with the team: Yardbird (33 Bridges St.) \"It's a relatively new restaurant, no reservations, just an example of the new Hong Kong palate - extremely cosmopolitan, influenced by a lot of local ingredients.\" Power ballads: Break the ice with business partners by...singing. \"Neway (28 Jaffe Rd.) and Red MR (5 Tonnochy Rd.) are both great options, but be prepared for a heavy dose of piano ballads. I subvert this by plugging in my own iPod. I think I've performed 'Let's Dance' by David Bowie over 500 times at this point.\" Where to mix business with pleasure: Dragon-I (60 Wyndham St.) \"The guy who owns the club loves soul music, '70s French disco, and hip-hop. It's got a lounge feel. I always end up running into someone I know, whether they're in music, entertainment, fashion, manufacturing, consumer electronics.\" Tourist trap: Take in the city views from Victoria Peak. \"It's an incredible view of the glass-and-steel architecture of the city with the harbor, and the tropical islands around it. Even in poor weather, it's very dramatic. When it's sunny, it's incredibly beautiful.\" Before heading home: Pick up some street noodles with extra chili at the airport before flying back to the states. \"It's the perfect meal before 13 hours on a plane.\" (Editing by Lauren Young and Cynthia Osterman)"

      "articleBody": "(Adds broker comment, share price, Canada's Potash Corp stake) By Rosalba O'Brien SANTIAGO, March 17 (Reuters) - SQM fertilizer company has fired its chief executive after it became embroiled in an election campaign financing scandal that has rocked the Chilean establishment, tainting business leaders and politicians with close links to the 1973-1990 dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. SQM, which has the rights to some of the world's largest reserves of nitrates and lithium, said after a board meeting on Monday night that it had \"agreed to terminate\" the contract of CEO Patricio Contesse, who was with the company for more than 25 years. Shortly after the announcement, SQM said it would voluntarily comply with a demand this month by Chile's internal revenue service to hand over tax information for the last six years. Contesse had tried to block the move but he was rejected by the courts. Authorities are investigating whether money from SQM and other companies was channeled illicitly to electoral campaigns for the Independent Democratic Union (UDI), Chile's biggest conservative party. The head of the UDI resigned March 11. UDI is part of a right wing coalition with 44 seats in the lower house of parliament compared with President Michelle Bachelet's ruling left wing coalition's 67 seats. UDI has eight senators and Bachelet's coalition 21. The owners of financial firm Banco Penta have already been charged with bribery and tax evasion in a scandal that has angered Chileans, proud of their reputation for being one of the least corrupt and most investor-friendly economies in Latin America. Prosecutors say they have evidence that fake receipts used by Penta's owners to dodge taxes were used to make illegal campaign finance contributions. SQM is no stranger to scandal. Last year, Chile's financial regulator fined brokers and company executives including Chairman Julio Ponce, Pinochet's former son-in-law, over market manipulation. SQM's deputy CEO and company veteran Patricio de Solminihac will take over from Contesse, the firm said. Brokers at BanChile said in a note that the appointment was \"good news\" and \"a first step towards confronting market worries linked to the company's corporate governance.\" SQM has struggled with lower iodine prices and seen its shares fall around 10 percent in March. On Tuesday they were trading flat at 14,200 pesos, valuing the company at around $6 billion. Canada's Potash Corp owns an approximate 32 percent stake in SQM's dual share structure and appoints three of the eight board seats.

      "articleBody": "(Adds detail on plan, adds background on LightSquared bankruptcy) By Nick Brown NEW YORK, March 17 (Reuters) - Cerberus Capital Management and Solus Alternative Asset Management on Tuesday proposed a new plan to restructure bankrupt wireless venture LightSquared, with the support of billionaire Charles Ergen, LightSquared's largest lender. The two private equity firms would pay most of Ergen's $1 billion debt in cash, purchasing $950 million of it and then accepting repayment in the form of second-lien notes, allowing other lenders to retain higher-priority payback notes. They would also take 34 percent of LightSquared's post-bankruptcy equity. The plan is designed to compete with a LightSquared-backed one whose fairness is the subject of an ongoing trial in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. Phil Falcone's Harbinger Capital Partners, LightSquared's current owner, would keep 44 percent of the equity but cede operational control, the same treatment it would receive under the plan supported by LightSquared. The fairness trial continued on Tuesday, and Judge Shelley Chapman said she would hold off on considering the Cerberus plan. A lawyer for a committee overseeing LightSquared's bankruptcy added that his panel may try to trump Cerberus' plan with a new one. \"There may be other amendments today to the existing plan that overtake the amendment that was just announced,\" attorney Joshua Sussberg told Chapman. But having Ergen's support could be a key bargaining chip for Cerberus. Ergen, the Dish Network Corp chairman whose big stake in LightSquared gives him significant negotiating clout, vehemently opposes LightSquared's plan, which would pay most of his claim in notes rather than cash.

      "articleBody": "WASHINGTON, March 17 (Reuters) - Top executives of U.S. airlines and their Middle East competitors clashed in Washington on Tuesday over whether \"open skies\" deals are fair, and each side ramped up efforts to sway U.S. regulators at a high-profile forum. U.S. carriers charge the Gulf airlines are benefiting unfairly from government subsidies. A coalition of Delta Air Lines Inc, United Continental Holdings Inc, American Airlines Group Inc and their labor unions accused Gulf rivals of receiving more than $40 billion in government subsidies. U.S. carriers say the Gulf airlines benefit unfairly from more than $40 billion in government subsidies that have allowed them to drive down prices and begin pushing U.S. airlines out of key markets. Executives are expected to air their concerns at a conference sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation. Emirates Airline, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways have denied receiving improper subsidies, saying U.S. airlines have lost market share in part because of inferior service. Delta, United, and American have called on the Obama administration to address whether to renegotiate open skies agreements with Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The Obama administration has said it takes competition concerns of the U.S. airlines seriously, but remains \"committed to the open skies policy\" which it says has helped travelers, the U.S. aviation industry and the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Bill Shuster told reporters the panel has asked the administration to look into the subsidy allegations, which he said appear valid. \"They're state-owned companies, and they're getting what we believe are infusions of cash, which is not fair,\" Shuster said. According to prepared remarks reviewed by reporters, American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker plans to tell the conference that subsidies for the Gulf airlines \"distort the competitive marketplace,\" and unless something is done, U.S. airlines, the U.S. economy, and U.S. jobs will pay a very expensive price.\" Etihad CEO James Hogan delivered a spirited defense of his company, saying the government of Abu Dhabi did provide startup capital and loans, but did so as a rational shareholder, and is expecting and getting returns on its investments. \"I don't apologize for anything,\" Hogan told attendees at a conference sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \"Shareholder loans and equity? That's business.\" U.S. airlines complain that the Gulf airlines are taking away passengers and putting U.S. jobs at risk. Hogan said his airline has helped the United States by buying 787 Dreamliners from Chicago-based Boeing Co., delivering 180,000 passengers a year to the three U.S. airlines that have lodged complaints with the U.S. government and supporting travel to six U.S. cities. As for whether the Gulf airlines are violating the open skies agreements, \"that's an issue for the two governments to discuss,\" Hogan said. Captain Rick Dominguez of the Air Line Pilots Association, which backs the U.S. carriers' complaint, disputed Hogan's contention that government aid to his company was a loan rather than a subsidy. \"When you have a loan that has no repayment schedule, and later years is actually forgiven, was it ever a loan?\" Dominguez asked. Last week, the European Commission said it will address French and German complaints about alleged subsidies later this year when it proposes a commercial aviation agreement with the Gulf region. Lufthansa Group Chief Executive Officer Carsten Spohr said at the Chamber event that bilateral agreements with Qatar and the United Arab Emirates \"must be reviewed and must be renegotiated.\" (Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Joseph B.

      "articleBody": "* American Airlines shares up; oil prices fall * Investors wait for Fed comment on rate hikes * Indexes down: Dow 0.9 pct, S&P 0.6 pct, Nasdaq 0.2 pct (Updates to midday) By Caroline Valetkevitch March 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday following a rally in the previous session, hit by declines in commodity-related shares and nervousness ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting. Materials were the weakest S&P sector with a 1.5 percent decline, led by Dupont, which was down 3.1 percent at $74.68. The energy sector was down 0.9 percent as oil prices fell further, pressured by concerns over a growing supply glut. Investors were also anxious as the Federal Open Market Committee kicked off its meeting, which will be followed by a statement from Chair Janet Yellen Wednesday afternoon. Investors hope the statement will bring insight on the timing of an interest rate hike. \"People are waiting for the Fed to provide some degree of clarity going forward,\" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. Most economists expect the Fed to remove a pledge to be \"patient\" about raising interest rates from its statement, but O'Rourke said, \"if they're still on pace for a mid-year move, whatever language they use doesn't make a difference.\" At 12:32 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average fell 158.98 points, or 0.88 percent, to 17,818.44, the S&P 500 lost 11.95 points, or 0.57 percent, to 2,069.24 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 9.00 points, or 0.18 percent, to 4,920.51. While higher rates are a sign of strength in the U.S. economy, some investors question whether the economy is strong enough to handle the increased borrowing costs. Johnson & Johnson weighed most heavily on the S&P 500 with a 1.4 percent decline to $99.61. The benchmark S&P 500 index on Monday had seen its biggest percentage gain since Feb. 3. Last week, the Dow and S&P registered their third week of losses. Shares in American Airlines rose 6 percent to 53.22 after an announcement that it would join the S&P 500. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,968 to 1,005, for a 1.96-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,611 issues fell and 1,009 advanced, for a 1.60-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The S&P 500 was posting 15 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 65 new highs and 53 new lows. (Editing by W Simon and Nick Zieminski)"

      "articleBody": "(Adds background) SANTIAGO, March 17 (Reuters) - Codelco, the world's biggest copper producer, said on Tuesday it was still working to get a key production unit at its newest mine running at capacity, following a delayed and problematic start-up process. The roaster, used to reduce levels of arsenic in the ore at the Ministro Hales mine to make copper ready for use in traditional smelters, is still not fully operational. \"It's still in the start-up phase. When it's running at capacity we will inform (the market),\" the Chilean state-owned company told Reuters. Codelco admitted for the first time last July that Ministro Hales was behind schedule because of problems with the roaster. In November it said it was undergoing repair work and would restart around early December. Finland's Outotec made the roaster and will, under contractual obligations, cover any costs relating to fixing the equipment, Codelco said in October. Ministro Hales, which was in its ramp-up phase in 2014 and produced 109,000 tonnes of copper from January to September, is emblematic in many ways both of Codelco's hopes and its challenges. It has been key to boosting copper output but has been dogged with problems at the roaster, which sources said forced it to delay sales in China last year. Codelco, facing high energy prices and falling ore grades, is plowing billions of dollars into revamping old mines and launching new projects in a bid to secure its top spot.

      "articleBody": "(Adds comments by vice chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff) By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON, March 17 (Reuters) - The Pentagon is concerned that congressional funding for lists of \"unfunded priorities\" submitted by the U.S. military services will drain money out of other higher-priority programs, a top official said on Tuesday. Congress uses the unfunded lists as it shapes the yearly budget plan submitted by the Pentagon, often using them to promote specific programs. Big arms makers count on the lists to help underpin their lobbying efforts. Admiral James Winnefeld, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the U.S. Defense Department worked for a year to develop a budget that balanced funding and military requirements across the U.S. military, but the \"unfunded lists\" opened the door for lawmakers to \"cherry-pick\" and fund programs deemed less important by the Pentagon. \"If Congress is going to cherry-pick from an unfunded list and pick something that they love, then something that we think we need is going to have to fall off,\" Winnefeld told Reuters after a conference hosted by Credit Suisse and McAleese & Associates. \"The problem ... is that they're not going to give us more money to fund these things so something else will have to come out of the budget that we thought was more important.\" Last year, the Navy added 22 Boeing Co EA-18G electronic attack jets to its unfunded list after leaving them out of its budget. Congress ultimately funded 15 jets, allowing Boeing to extend that production line through the end of 2017. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus last week signed off on a list of unfunded priorities compiled by Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan Greenert. The list has now gone to Defense Secretary Ash Carter and the Joint Chiefs for review. Greenert suggested earlier this month that the list could include some F/A-18E/F Super Hornets built by Boeing to deal with a possible shortfall in fighter jets given delays in extending the life of older-model Boeing F/A-18 jets. Boeing is counting on additional orders from the Navy to extend the St. Louis production line where it builds the planes beyond 2017. Navy officials say they are also keen to see production continue to preserve the option of buying Boeing EA-18G electronic attack jets, which are built on the same line, given ongoing studies about possible electronic warfare needs.

      "articleBody": "TORONTO, March 17 (Reuters) - When retailer Lululemon Athletica pulled its \"Define Jacket\" off the shelves in 2013, customers were dismayed. When it embarrassingly recalled its signature yoga pants for being too sheer, they rushed for the exits. Now the jacket is back, and so are customers, and that has helped boost Lululemon's shares more than 70 percent from their low last June. In January, the company forecast an increase in same-store sales that was roughly double analysts' expectations, suggesting that the nearly two years of work it took to fix the supply-chain and other problems that had led to the \"pantsgate\" recall are paying off. Some Wall Street brokers have turned negative on the stock ahead of Lululemon's next earnings report on March 26, but many longtime shoppers have regained enthusiasm. They say a wider selection of styles, colors and prints are at the core of the revival overseen by Lululemon's new chief executive, Laurent Potdevin, who started in January 2014 after serving as president of TOMS Shoes. Fashion bloggers say there was a two-year dry spell during which selection and variety were limited. Now they often update their blogs with new products and styles several times a day. \"The sheer amount of products and options that Lululemon now produces is staggering,\" said Suzanne Lane, a Lululemon fan who started her Agent Athletica blog less than a year ago. HUNGER, NOT STARVATION Potdevin, who was hired for his experience in supply-chain systems, said that making product and quality a \"clear area of focus\" was his aim when he joined Lululemon. \"We've got a very loyal guest and she's coming back and she's coming back more often,\" he said on a call in December. Some shoppers say they have experienced a \"180 degree\" change in service, including a looser return policy. Stores now take phone orders, ship for free, and also hold products in-store for customers. Lululemon has also tweaked its practice of making only limited qualities of an item available to spur demand and minimize inventory. Now, Potdevin said, \"while we don't mind our guests being hungry for our product, we don't want them to starve for it.\" QUESTIONS LINGER The investment community says Potdevin deserves praise for leading a team that has markedly improved selection and service. \"Can he get the culture back to where it was? (That) remains to be seen, but he's certainly making great strides,\" said Roger Hardy, chairman of Hardy Capital Partners, a longtime shareholder. Others fear Lululemon is still at risk from growing competition. Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to \"sell\" this month, citing pressure from Under Armour, Gap's Athleta, among others. \"We need to have confidence that the turnaround is going to continue and accelerate,\" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which has exited its Lululemon position. Some also worry about valuation. The stock trades at a higher price-earnings ratio, 30.6 times forward earnings, than many of its peers. That is well off its 2007 peak of around 90, shortly after the company went public. The historical median is 32.3. NO SHADOW Unlike previous CEOs, Potdevin will not have to operate in the shadow of founder Chip Wilson, who quit the board recently after years of disputes. Last June, he attacked fellow board members for being too focused on short-term results. Two sources familiar with the matter said the split was exacerbated when the board on three occasions turned down a clothing fabric created by Wilson's wife. That fabric has since become the base material at the Wilson family's new clothing retailer, Kit and Ace. The sources, who are not authorized to publicly discuss the matter, said tensions came to a head in December, when Wilson was the only board member excluded from a subcommittee meeting. They said the board was informed of his resignation only minutes before Wilson's departure. Lululemon declined to comment.

      "articleBody": "(Adds reaction from CN Rail, quotes, background) By David Ljunggren OTTAWA, March 17 (Reuters) - Canada's transportation watchdog said on Tuesday that recent fiery derailments of trains hauling crude oil mean a new generation of stronger tanker wagons should be introduced ahead of schedule. The Transportation Safety Board (TSB) is probing two accidents within the last month involving Canadian National Railway Co oil trains which came off the tracks and caught fire near the small northern Ontario town of Gogama. Both trains were hauling CPC-1232 crude tankers, meant to be safer than the older DOT-111 models that blew up in downtown Lac-Megantic, Quebec in 2013, killing 47 people. Canada last week unveiled tough standards for a new generation of tanker cars that would replace the CPC-1232s by 2025 at the latest. \"While the proposed standards look promising, the TSB has concerns about the implementation timeline, given initial observations of the performance of CPC-1232 cars in recent derailments,\" the agency said in a release. \"If older tank cars, including the CPC-1232 cars, are not phased out sooner, then the regulator and industry need to take more steps to reduce the risk of derailments or consequences following a derailment carrying flammable liquids,\" it said, but gave no details. The agency said track failures may have played a role in each of the Gogama derailments as well as in the case of an oil train that left the tracks near Minnipuka, also in northern Ontario. No crude caught fire in that accident. The TSB has issued a safety advisory letter asking the federal transport ministry to review the risk assessments conducted for the area. \"Petroleum crude oil unit trains transporting heavily-loaded tank cars will tend to impart higher than usual forces to the track infrastructure during their operation,\" said the agency. \"These higher forces expose any weaknesses that may be present in the track structure, making the track more susceptible to failure.\" It noted trains traveling in the area were under orders to travel slowly to protect against various infrastructure and track maintenance issues. CN spokesman Jim Feeny said the company \"has enhanced its already rigorous infrastructure and mechanical inspection procedures on this northern Ontario rail corridor\". The office of Transport Minister Lisa Raitt - which has overall responsibility for regulating the rail industry - was not immediately available for comment.

      "articleBody": "NEW YORK, March 17 (Reuters) - Aleris Corp may expand its capacity for production of aluminum sheet for automobiles in Europe when the economy there recovers, its top executive said, as demand for lightweight materials continues to grow. The company has the \"capability\" to add a second continuous annealing line at its rolling mill in Duffel, Belgium, though it has not yet decided on any specifics, Steven Demetriou, Aleris' chairman and chief executive, said in a recent interview. Aleris completed a $70 million expansion in 2013 at Duffel, one of Europe's largest rolling mills which supplies Mercedes and Audi, and announced plans last year to start producing auto body sheet in the United States. Fuel efficiency standards are prompting many car manufacturers, such as Ford Motor Co, to switch to aluminum, which is lighter than steel. \"When that market improves that's a tremendous growth opportunity for us,\" Demetriou said of Europe. \"It's a cyclical business. We are preparing ourselves for an eventual recovery.\" Demetriou said any expansion in Europe would likely come after the company completes the ramp-up of its aerospace plate mill in Zhenjiang, China, which opened in 2013, and finishes construction of its automotive body sheet facility in Lewisport, Kentucky. The company is still on track to ship the first sheet from Kentucky in early 2017 and Aleris has capacity to add a third line once it is up and running, he said. \"We're upgrading the entire plant to be auto-ready in a few years,\" Demetriou said. The string of investments is being funded from the more than $500 million in cash generated from the recent sales of Aleris' extrusions and recycling businesses, and comes as the company increases its focus on automotive, aerospace and construction industries. An initial public offering is still a possibility for the company in the coming years, Demetriou said. Private equity firms Oaktree Capital Management LP, a unit of Oaktree Capital Group LLC, and Apollo Global Management, are among Aleris' biggest shareholders.

      "articleBody": "March 17 (Reuters) - A new $110 million lawsuit filed on Tuesday claims a U.S. division at Swiss drugmaker Novartis has routinely denied female employees equal pay and promotional opportunities, five years after the pharmaceutical giant was hit with a nine-figure jury verdict over similar claims. The proposed class action suit filed in U.S. federal court in Manhattan says Texas-based Alcon Laboratories Inc, which was acquired by Novartis in 2010, maintains a \"boy's club atmosphere\" that is hostile to women and bars them from leadership positions. An spokeswoman at Alcon, which specializes in eyecare products, deferred questions to Novartis Corp, which did not immediately return a request for comment. A U.S. jury in 2010 ordered Novartis to pay more than $250 million in a separate class action that alleged widespread gender discrimination. At the time, it was the largest award in an employment discrimination case in U.S. history. The company at the time said it would adopt reforms to prevent discrimination and retaliation against employees who complained. The plaintiffs in Tuesday's suit, Elyse Dickerson and Susan Orr, say the company violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits gender discrimination by employers, and the U.S. Equal Pay Act. \"For years, the company paid them less than similarly-situated men, discriminated against them in assignments and other career-enhancing opportunities, and denied them promotions in favor of ... men,\" the suit says. Dickerson said she was fired from her post as a global director for complaining about inequities at the company, and is seeking $10 million and her job back. Orr, a research scientist, said the lack of promotions forced her to resign and is seeking at least $100 million on behalf of a proposed class of thousands of female Alcon employees. In its most recent annual report released in January, Novartis said it has \"continued to focus on the promotion of women.\" Tuesday's suit, however, claims the company has no plan in place to address gender issues at Alcon. Dickerson and Orr are represented by the national class action law firm Sanford Heisler Kimpel, which also brought the earlier suit against Novartis. The case is Dickerson v. Novartis Corp, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 1:15-cv-1980. (Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and G Crosse)"

The Export-Import Bank, which provides support to U.S. exporters and the buyers of U.S. goods, is targeted for closure by some conservative Republicans who say it usurps the role of the private sector and provides \"welfare\" for big business. The agency faces a June deadline for renewal. If the U.S. Ex-Im bank is not available, \"airlines are going to go somewhere else to get their aircraft,\" Ray Conner, chief executive officer of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said at an aviation summit in Washington, D.C. The credit facility offered for exports such as Boeing aircraft helps create jobs, has very low risk, \"and last time I checked it made money,\" he said. \"This is not a bad thing and we should all support it.\" Conner also voiced concern about the poor state of U.S. transportation infrastructure and a slowdown at West Coast ports. Boeing ships large volumes of goods by rail and highway. Last year a train derailment caused the loss of six 737 jet fuselages. The West Coast port slowdown was \"extremely difficult\" for Boeing and the company is still working through the issues it caused, he said. The slowdown, amid protracted contract talks with longshoreman, ended in February with predictions that it could take two months for congestion to subside. Boeing's aircraft production depends on precise delivery of parts, leaving it vulnerable to shipping disruptions.

The euro rose against the dollar for a second straight session, after hitting a recent 12-year low, while the dollar dipped against a basket of major currencies. European equity markets retreated from gains built on the euro's decline, which cheapens the price of exports from the euro zone. London's market was an exception, and Asian markets ended higher. U.S. crude oil hit a six-year low of $42.63 a barrel before recovering to $43.03, still down 1.9 percent. It has fallen in eight of the last nine sessions due to oversupply and the possibility that a nuclear agreement with Iran could add to the glut. Brent crude fell 2.26 percent to $52.72. Fed policymakers kicked off a two-day meeting on Tuesday, and many analysts expect them to remove the reference to being \"patient\" on rate rises from their policy statement on Wednesday. That would put the Fed a step closer to the first rate hike since 2006. Economists polled by Reuters are almost evenly split on whether a rate increase will come in June or later in the year. Recent U.S. data, including Tuesday's on February housing starts, has fueled talk that the Fed will remain on hold as long as possible. \"A lot of today's decline is speculation on how the Fed will respond, along with the sense that (U.S.) growth is weak,\" said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland, Ohio. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 178.60 points, or 0.99 percent, at 17,798.82. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 14.53 points, or 0.70 percent, at 2,066.66. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 18.10 points, or 0.37 percent, at 4,911.41. The MSCI International ACWI Price Index slipped 0.3 percent while European shares lost 0.9 percent, pulling back from a 7-1/2-year high. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 10/32 in price, pushing the yield down to 2.0629 percent. After weakening to a 12-year low of $1.0457 at the start of the week, the euro had secured a firm foothold back above $1.06. It rose 0.7 percent to $1.0638 on Tuesday.

Investors held off on making big bets after the Federal Open Market Committee kicked off its meeting, which will be followed by a statement from Chair Janet Yellen Wednesday afternoon. Most economists expect the Fed to remove a pledge to be \"patient\" about raising interest rates from its statement, giving it flexibility on when to kick off its first rate hike since 2006. While higher rates would make Treasuries more attractive than many equities to some investors, the strong economic indicators that would lead to a rate rise may ultimately boost stocks. \"In front of the Fed meeting, people tend to do less. They tend to react to it rather than try to position in front of it,\" said Peter Cecchini, managing director and chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. U.S. housing starts plunged to their lowest level in a year in February likely as harsh weather kept builders at home, in the latest indication the economy hit a soft patch in the first quarter. The benchmark S&P 500 index on Monday had seen its biggest percentage gain since Feb. 3. Last week, the Dow and S&P registered their third week of losses. At 11:05 a.m., the Dow Jones industrial average fell 160.33 points, or 0.89 percent, to 17,817.09, the S&P 500 lost 12.77 points, or 0.61 percent, to 2,068.42 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 17.21 points, or 0.35 percent, to 4,912.30. Materials were the weakest S&P sector with a 1.3 percent decline, led by Dupont, which was down 2.8 percent at $74.89. Johnson & Johnson weighed most heavily on the S&P with a 1.3 percent decline to $99.78. The energy sector was down 0.9 percent as oil prices fell with Brent crude down 2 percent to $52.84 a barrel and U.S. crude off 1.9 percent at $43.07 as concerns over a growing supply glut weighed on the market. Shares in American Airlines rose 5.6 percent to 53.03 after an announcement that it would join the S&P 500. Black Diamond Inc shares rose 28.5 percent to $9.08.

      "articleBody": "WASHINGTON, March 17 (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers took aim at the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law Tuesday, unveiling a plan that would gut regulators' authority to manage the collapse of big banks and give Congress direct control of the U.S. consumer finance bureau's budget. The effort to repeal parts of Dodd-Frank is part of a broader fiscal 2016 budget plan released by the House of Representatives budget committee that calls for eliminating deficits and also repealing the president's signature Affordable Care Act. The proposal, led by House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price, pledges to make \"great strides in repealing onerous policies enacted under Dodd-Frank that are hurting financial institutions both large and small.\" Republicans have for years rallied against a measure in Dodd-Frank known as \"orderly liquidation authority\" which allows U.S. regulators to intervene in the event a large, risky bank collapses. They have said the measure perpetuates government bailouts, and that any collapse of a large firm should be left to a bankruptcy court. In the past, Republicans were unable to get any traction repealing the measure, largely because the U.S. Senate was controlled by Democrats. The plan still faces major hurdles, including a likely veto from President Barack Obama if it ever reaches his desk. Nevertheless, Republicans in the House are making a fresh push targeting bank resolution and other major Dodd-Frank provisions now that the Senate is also controlled by Republicans. In addition to targeting resolution powers by banking regulators, the Republican budget plan also takes aim at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a new regulatory agency that serves to protect consumers from predatory loan practices by credit-card and mortgage servicing companies. The bureau's budget is not appropriated by Congress and is funded through the Federal Reserve. That has irked Republicans because it gives them less control over the regulator. In addition to targeting the Dodd-Frank law, Tuesday's plan also calls for privatizing housing finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were both seized by the government in 2008 after they nearly collapsed beneath the weight of bad loans. \"As long as they continue to enjoy federal support, taxpayers remain exposed to more than $5 trillion of outstanding commitments belonging to the firms,\" the plan says.

The Constitutional Court imposed a six-hour overnight ban which took effect in mid-February on use of the Fenoco coal railway operated by Drummond and two rival miners, cutting mine-to-port transport by 25 percent, Drummond Vice President for Communication, Pablo Urrutia, said. \"Before the restriction we were managing 15 to 16 trains a day and right now we are managing 12 to 13. It clearly has an impact,\" he said. \"Right now we can manage it. So far because we have stock in place we are not having any problems in terms of meeting obligations.\" Colombia is the world's fourth-biggest coal exporter, shipping mainly to Europe after rising gas production in the United States crimped demand in that once-large market. Coal is Colombia's most important export after crude oil. European API2 2015 coal futures remain near a nine-year low of $55.60 per tonne hit on January 26. Colombia's coal sector may prove one of the most resilient amid low prices given low labor costs and use of technology. Fenoco has filed a petition with the court to lift the restrictions and says it has undertaken steps to address the grievances of rural residents whose complaint about noise was behind the overnight ban. The family-owned company is working to expand its stock holding capacity at its port on the Caribbean coast to 1.5 million tonnes, up from 1 million tonnes now. The company will inaugurate a new ship loader in the next few months which will double capacity to 60 million tonnes and it has now received three licenses to expand its northern La Loma mine, a process Urrutia said is likely to start next year. \"As we expand, we will be able to use that larger capacity at the port,\" Urrutia said. Drummond aims to produce 30 million tonnes of coal in 2015, 31 percent of the 97.8 million tonnes Colombia's government has forecast for output nationwide this year. (Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)"

      "articleBody": "(Adds details, VP comments) MOSCOW, March 17 (Reuters) - Russia's top mobile phone operator MTS said revenue growth would slow marginally this year but warned that macroeconomic volatility could prompt it to revise its guidance. The company posted an almost 92 percent fall in fourth-quarter net profit, hit by a slump in the rouble because of lower oil prices and a conflict in Ukraine. MTS expects sales to rise by at least 2 percent this year, compared with 3.1 percent in 2014, it said in a statement. In Russia, its biggest market, sales growth is seen at more than 3 percent against 5.6 percent last year. \"Our forecasts are rather aggressive. It's less than last year but compare it with the market, competitors and economic forecasts,\" MTS Vice President Vasyl Latsanych told reporters. \"If the market develops as we plan, we will not have to increase prices significantly and we believe consumption will grow,\" he added. Rival Megafon, which ranks second by sales and subscribers, last week forecast flat revenue in 2015 and said core profitability would likely decline. MTS, part of the Sistema conglomerate, said it was \"cautiously targeting\" a margin on operating income before depreciation and amortisation (OIBDA) of more than 40 percent against 42.7 percent in 2014. But it said significant macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility across its markets of operation could cause the company to revisit its guidance. Its fourth-quarter net profit dropped 91.7 percent, year-on-year, to 1.6 billion roubles ($25.86 million) mainly because of an 8.9 billion rouble foreign exchange loss on its foreign-currency debt. It was also hit by a 5.2 billion rouble loss provision related to its deposit at insolvent Ukrainian bank DeltaBank it had warned about earlier in March. OIBDA fell 5.3 percent to 42.6 billion roubles, also reflecting the impact of higher costs related to roaming and an increase in payroll. Revenue rose 2.3 percent to 107.2 billion roubles with Russian business offseting declines in its second-biggest market, Ukraine, where results were hit by cessation of operations in Crimea and fighting in the east as well as economic turmoil.

      "articleBody": "* FTSEurofirst 300 down 0.9 pct, below 7-1/2 year high * Peugeot falls as car sales growth lower than sector * DAX underperforms as ZEW survey lower than expected By Atul Prakash LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - European shares retreated from a 7-1/2-year high on Tuesday, with PSA Peugeot Citroen leading automakers lower after the release of car sales data and a disappointing German economic sentiment survey. Germany's DAX, down 1.6 percent, underperformed the broader market after hitting a new record high in the previous session. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.9 percent at 1,580.78 points at 1430 GMT, after hitting a multi-year high of 1,598.03 earlier in the session. The STOXX Europe Automobiles and Parts index fell 1.4 percent, dragged down by a 4.6 percent fall in Peugeot after the automaker's vehicle sales rose less than the sector in February. \"The new car sales from Peugeot are disappointing. Peugeot underperformed the European auto market in February with an increase limited at 1.1 percent,\" a Paris-based trader said. Data from the Association of European Carmakers (ACEA) showed new car registrations in Europe rose 7 percent in the month of February, fuelled by double-digit sales growth in Italy and Spain. The European stock market saw further selling pressure after the Mannheim-based think tank ZEW said its monthly survey of economic sentiment increased to 54.8 in March from 53.0 in February. This was below a Reuters consensus forecast of 58.2. ZEW warned that a lack of progress towards defusing the Greek and Ukraine crises was dampening sentiment. \"The ZEW survey reminds that the underlying story in Europe is still far from clear. There is plenty of risk in the region such as low inflation, a lack of coordinated reforms and uncertainty over Greece,\" Lorne Baring, managing director of B Capital Wealth Management, said. \"All of these could still give investors a scare in 2015.\" However, some analysts stayed positive on the market's longer-term outlook. The FTSEurofirst 300 index has risen more than 15 percent so far this year as bond purchases from the European Central Banks drove yields on government debt to record lows, leading investors to seek higher returns in equities. \"European assets are in a powerful catch-up rally, which is not over,\" said Pascal Blanque, chief investment officer at Amundi, which has 850 billion euros ($902 billion) in assets under management. \"With the euro falling, the QE (quantitative easing) starting, the recent improvement in macro indicators, European assets are in a sweet spot. It could last for a while, as long as global growth remains above 3 percent.\" Greek banks rose 2.1 percent, helped by a 5.7 percent gain in Bank of Piraeus and a 2 percent stronger Alpha Bank on expectations that the Greek debt crisis will eventually get resolved. A Greek government official said on Tuesday that Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has asked for a meeting with top European policymakers including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi on the sidelines of an EU summit this week.

      "articleBody": "(Adds comments, status of other bond payments, mediator declining to comment, stock price) By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK, March 17 (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc said on Tuesday it plans to exit its custody business in Argentina as soon as possible, after a U.S. judge refused to lift an injunction that blocked the bank from processing interest payments on $2.3 billion of Argentina bonds. In a defeat for the bank, clients and Argentina itself, Citigroup said it made its decision in light of U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa's March 12 order letting the injunction stand, and Argentina's renewed threats to strip its banking license and impose criminal, civil and administrative sanctions. Citigroup may sell portions of the business or end some customer relationships, according to a letter to Griesa from Citigroup's lawyer, Karen Wagner. The New York-based bank also said it will keep trying to overturn Griesa's order on appeal. Citigroup called itself the victim of an \"unprecedented international conflict of laws.\" Argentina's economy ministry had no immediate comment. Citigroup's decision may further complicate Argentina's efforts to pay bondholders and return to global debt markets, more than 13 years after its 2001 default on roughly $100 billion of bonds. Most investors holding Argentina bonds exchanged them for bonds worth much less, but a group of bondholder holdouts rejected the swaps. These holdouts, including billionaire Paul Singer's Elliott Management LP hedge fund and its NML Capital affiliate, as well as the Aurelius Capital Management hedge fund, have insisted they be paid in full if holders of exchanged bonds are paid. In his March 12 order, Griesa ordered Citigroup not to process a $3.7 million interest payment due March 31 on bonds issued under Argentine law. The judge had previously blocked payments on bonds governed by New York and English law. His injunction last year set off another Argentina default on July 31. WAITING GAME Griesa's repeated rulings in favor of the holdouts have prompted defiance from Argentina and its president Cristina Fernandez, who has labeled the holdouts as \"vultures\" bent on astronomical profits. Fernandez cannot seek a third term, and her successor will take office in December. The March 12 order \"put an end to any serious thought for Argentina to issue foreign currency debt to foreign investors,\" said Mark Weidemaier, a University of North Carolina law professor specializing in sovereign debt disputes. \"It now becomes a waiting game,\" he said. \"The decision gives holdouts more leverage, but it might be that the current administration in Argentina is not interested in settling, and will hand the problem to its successor.\" Spokesmen for Elliott and Aurelius declined to comment. As custodian, Citigroup is supposed to transfer interest payments to clearinghouses that in turn pay bondholders. The bank has portrayed itself as an innocent third party stuck with an untenable choice between ignoring Griesa, or putting its Argentina banking license in jeopardy. Griesa expressed sympathy for Citigroup, but said Argentina's recalcitrance caused Citigroup's predicament. In his March 12 order, he also said any third party that aids Argentina's payment process would violate his injunction. Griesa again urged the country to work with court-appointed mediator Daniel Pollack to end its disputes with the holdouts. Pollack declined to comment. Citigroup tried to downplay its decision to quit the Argentina custody business, saying that business has \"no meaningful connection with banking business in general,\" and concerns only servicing assets belonging to clients. The bank's shares were up 14 cents at $53.83 at mid-afternoon. The case is NML Capital Ltd v. Argentina, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 08-06978.

      "articleBody": "(Refiles for wider distribution, no changes to story) By Mike Kentz NEW YORK, March 16 (IFR) - The Intercontinental Exchange plans to infuse several of the default management funds within its derivatives clearing houses with more of the firm's own cash this year in an effort to improve its risk mitigation capabilities and provide client clearing members with cost savings. The controversial decision comes as industry debate as to how much capital a clearing house should contribute to the management of a major bank failure in derivatives markets intensifies to fever pitch. \"We believe that placing more of the firm's own capital at the top of default waterfalls materially reduces regulatory capital charges on our members,\" Jeffrey Sprecher, CEO of ICE, told IFR on the sidelines of the Futures Industry Association's 2015 conference in Boca, Florida last week. \"Most of the recent debate has focused on the safety and soundness of clearing houses primarily - which is very important - but we also view having more 'skin in the game' as a tangible differentiating factor in terms of lowering costs to customers.\" The firm plans to voluntarily add US$22m to ICE Clear Europe's default waterfall, which protects against member failures in the European credit default swap market. The addition will bring the total skin-in-the-game contribution to US$50m. ICE also plans to contribute capital to ICE Clear Canada for the first time this year as well as to its planned clearing house in Singapore, which is expected to go live in the first half of this year. The New York Stock Exchange, which ICE now owns, will also contribute an additional US$60m to default funds operated by Options Clearing Corporation. The decision makes the exchange an industry leader on one side of a debate that has recently become an intense focal point of the derivatives market. Participants debated the issue on three separate panels at the FIA conference last week, and CFTC chairman Timothy Massad stressed the topic in his keynote address. He also plans to convene an agency-sponsored debate on the issue in Washington next week. \"As we make clearing houses even more important in the global financial system, we must pay attention to the risks that they can pose,\" he said in the conference keynote. DODD-FRANK THRUST Clearing houses have become hugely important to the management of derivatives market risk as a result of Dodd-Frank's mandate to clear the majority of over-the-counter swaps in an effort to reduce systemic risk. The percentage of swaps now overseen by the CFTC and cleared through central clearing houses has increased from 15% in December 2007 to 75% today, according to Massad. Major industry players such as JP Morgan say that clearing houses should have to post more of their own capital to cover against the default of a major clearing bank. Their argument, produced in a white paper and debated at several industry conferences over the past year, is that the clearing houses are for-profit entities that compete on the ability to reduce costs to clients, which could increase risk. Therefore clearing houses should be incentivised against such a 'race to the bottom' of risk standards by having more of their own capital at risk. The inclusion of more CCP capital would theoretically encourage the risk managers to be more careful. \"It's also important that we maintain the proper balance between the CCP and the clearing firms to guard against moral hazard,\" agreed Sprecher, referencing the decision to add more capital. DETRACTORS As Sprecher points out, the infusion of capital provides regulatory capital reductions to its bank clients. Putting more skin-in-the-game is good business. It is also not without its fair share of detractors. Shareholders and analysts have questioned whether the capital infusions are necessary, especially considering it chews up millions of additional capital that could be put to work elsewhere for investor benefit. CME Group, ICE's biggest competitor, resides staunchly in the 'unnecessary' camp. The firm has vehemently defended CCP risk management practices as thoroughly robust and refuses to bend to industry will to post more of its own capital to default funds. \"We are sizing the default waterfall funds on a daily basis based on a test that combines the stresses of the 2008 crisis, the 1987 stock market crash, the failure of Long-Term Capital Management, and all of these other major events - together - and then making sure there is still enough pre-paid capital to withstand the failure of the two largest clearing members in that scenario,\" said Sunil Cutinho, president of CME Clearing on an FIA conference panel. The firm also believes that a requirement to post more skin-in-the-game would allow banks to introduce more risk to the system without having to post additional capital to protect against it. The debate is likely to persist for several years as US regulators consider the various technical arguments. While CME believes it may be able to sway regulators into its camp, market participants largely - and perhaps unsurprisingly - fall into the camp supporting the ICE stance. \"I do think that ICE is being very provocative and very forward-looking in trying to be a part of the solution rather than fighting it,\" said the head of the clearing operations at one major bank. \"I don't think it's all self-serving just to get a capital save - I think they're meaningfully trying to change the industry in a way that makes sense to all constituents.\" A version of this story first appeared in the March 14 edition of IFR Magazine, a Thomson Reuters publication.

A tax audit for the 2006-2009 period when Porsche SE sought to take control of much-larger Volkswagen had determined the size of arrears, Poetsch said at the company's annual press conference. Payment of tax arrears may shrink the company's net liquidity to between 1.7 billion euros and 2.3 billion, compared with 2.27 billion in 2014, Poetsch said. There will probably be no increase in dividend payouts to shareholders for 2015. \"This is about complicated circumstances related to hedging operations,\" the CFO said, without being more specific. Stuttgart-based Porsche SE also said it is aiming for net income this year between 2.8 billion euros and 3.8 billion, compared with 3 billion in 2014. The company also said it was pondering further investment in technology firms as carmakers look for new opportunities by pushing into software businesses.

The review comes two days ahead of a meeting of FDA advisers to discuss the combination treatment, Breo Ellipta, and recommend whether it should be approved to treat asthma. The inhaled drug combination of a corticosteroid and vilanterol is already approved to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a breathing disability that gets worse with time and affects mostly smokers. Corticosteroids smoothen the inner surface of breathing pathways. Vilanterol belongs to a class of compounds called long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA) that have historically been linked to asthma-related deaths. Glaxo licensed vilanterol from Theravance Inc in 2002. Data showing Breo Ellipta's LABA component delayed the worsening of asthma symptoms could sway the FDA panel in its favor, analysts from Robert W. Baird & Co said last week. The FDA staff said on Tuesday there were no asthma-related deaths in Breo Ellipta studies it reviewed and that data on asthma-related hospitalizations were not observed uniformly in the 23 studies that Glaxo conducted. (1.usa.gov/1Fvj3r9) The data submitted by Glaxo showed that the safety profile of Breo Ellipta to treat asthma was similar to that of other combinations of steroids and LABA compounds, the FDA staff said. They also said advisers would discuss the fact that the benefit of adding a LABA compound to a steroid was not demonstrated consistently in the trials. Glaxo has three respiratory treatments on the market with a LABA compound and each of them carry a warning that the drug could increase the risk of asthma-related deaths. This possible side-effect was verified in a study that tested another one of Glaxo's LABA compounds, salmeterol, against a placebo. Salmeterol, which is approved in the United States under the brand name Serevent Diskus to treat asthma but only in combination with an inhaled steroid, has been available on the market since 1994.

That followed media reports on Monday that the general insurer was considering a sale of the operations, which are spread across Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Uruguay. RSA declined to comment. RSA has been retreating from secondary markets to help shore up its balance sheet and refocus its strategy after an accounting scandal at its Irish unit fuelled a series of profit warnings and bumper cash call. At its most recent results, the company said it still considered itself to have leadership positions in parts of Latin America as well as Scandinavia, the UK and Ireland, and Canada. While it has shed a number of assets, including a minority stake in its Indian joint venture and operations in China, they were all much smaller than its Latin American operations, which are valued at 500-650 million pounds ($740-$960 million). Ben Cohen, analyst at Canaccord Genuity said, strategically, a sale would leave RSA with a reliance on very mature markets, \"which is not a problem as long as you do it well\" he said, citing the example of Direct Line. Cohen said the deal would likely be at a healthy premium to its book value and the best scenario would be if cash was returned to shareholders, although the firm had not flagged any impending windfall and proceeds could be used to build RSA's capital position, which came out weaker than expected at results. Shares in RSA were a marginal outperformer in a flat FTSE 100, which Cohen said suggested there was some expectation in the market that the business could be put on the block.

The Federal Open Market Committee is due to start a two-day meeting on Tuesday and is expected to put out its statement and projections on Wednesday afternoon. Most economists expect the Fed to remove a pledge to be \"patient\" about raising interest rates from its statement, giving it flexibility on when to kick off its first rate hike since 2006. U.S. housing starts plunged to their lowest level in a year in February likely as harsh weather kept builders at home, in the latest indication the economy hit a soft patch in the first quarter. The benchmark S&P 500 index on Monday saw its biggest percentage gain since Feb. 3. Last week, the Dow and S&P registered their third week of losses. Some investors were giving back gains in the absence of big news while others were holding tight ahead of the Fed statement, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. \"We're very much in a wait-and-see mode until 2.30 p.m. tomorrow,\" said Hogan. At 9:38 a.m., the Dow Jones industrial average fell 91.77 points, or 0.51 percent, to 17,885.65, the S&P 500 lost 6.39 points, or 0.31 percent, to 2,074.8 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 6.04 points, or 0.12 percent, to 4,923.47. Retailer DSW Inc's shares were up 6 percent at $39.14 after a better-than-expected outlook, while Burlington Stores' shares were up 2.9 percent to $59 after its quarterly report. Shares in American Airlines rose 6 percent to 53.25 after news that it would join the S&P 500. Black Diamond Inc shares rose 28.8 percent $9.08. The outdoor pursuits equipment and clothing company said it hired advisors to explore strategic alternatives and it reported quarterly results. Brent crude fell below $54 a barrel in choppy trade as concerns over a growing supply glut weighed on the market. U.S. crude was at $43.11 a barrel, down 57 cents and slightly above 6-year lows of $42.85 marked on Monday. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,829 to 450, for a 4.06-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,440 issues fell and 602 advanced, for a 2.39-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The S&P 500 was posting 3 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 18 new highs and 20 new lows. (Reporting By Sinead Carew; Editing by W Simon and Nick Zieminski)"

      "articleBody": "* Albania to sell state oil firm this year-PM * Investors will be offered new exploration blocks * Albania says has 40 million tonnes of easily extractable oil By Benet Koleka TIRANA, March 17 (Reuters) - Albania wants to try again to privatise its state oil company this year, and will soon begin offering its blocks for oil and gas exploration, Prime Minister Edi Rama said on Tuesday. The previous Democratic Party government, which Rama's Socialist-led coalition ousted in June 2013, cancelled the sale two years ago to a private buyer. \"We will end the long-drawn process of the privatisation of the state-owned Albpetrol company this year,\" Rama said. \"Since the very first day, it was clear to us Albpetrol was an anachronism and a hybrid that could not meet the challenges of the future,\" he told oil executives. His audience included representatives of Shell, already active in Albania, Exxon Mobil, BP, Italy's Eni , Austria's OMV and Croatia's INA. Albpetrol is an upstream company only, having sold its oil refinery four years ago. Wooing investors, Rama said the government was determined to \"secure a favourable regime for the exploration and development of oil and gas\", including stabilizing fiscal clauses for the duration of contracts. Oil and gas reserves are estimated to amount to 400 million tonnes, of which 40 million are easily extractable, Energy Minister Damian Gjiknuri said. Thirteen onshore and offshore blocks can be explored for oil and gas, Rama and Gjiknuri said. \"Very soon we shall start procedures to give the first three blocks for exploration to interested companies,\" Gjiknuri said. Albanian law offered attractive fiscal terms during the exploration period, exempting companies from paying Value Added Tax, extending the research period from 5 to 7 years and the production time from 25 to 30 years, Gjiknuri said. Shell and Calgary, Canada-based Petromanas Energy Inc already operate a well offshore Albania and have said test flows found oil and gas, but are yet to establish its production capacity. The well is across the Adriatic Sea from Italy's offshore Val d'Agri field which pumps around 85,000 barrels per day. (Editing by William Hardy)"

In a letter to U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in Manhattan, Citigroup said it made its decision in light of his March 12 order letting the injunction stand, and Argentina's renewed threats to strip Citibank Argentina of its banking license and to impose criminal, civil and administrative sanctions. Citigroup has not decided how to exit the custody business, but may sell portions or end some customer relationships, according to the letter from its lawyer, Karen Wagner. Argentina's economy ministry had no immediate comment. Citigroup's decision marks the latest fallout in a long-running U.S. court battle stemming from Argentina's roughly $100 billion sovereign debt default in 2001. Most investors holding Argentina bonds later exchanged them for bonds worth much less, but a group of bondholders holdouts rejected the swaps. The holdouts, including billionaire Paul Singer's Elliott Management LP hedge fund and its NML Capital affiliate, as well as the Aurelius Capital Management hedge fund, have insisted they be paid in full if holders of the exchanged bonds are paid. Representatives for Elliott did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Aurelius had no immediate comment. The case is NML Capital Ltd v.

The companies did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. Pending regulatory clearances, they said they expected it to close in the second half of Couche-Tard's next fiscal year, which ends around April 2016. Couche-Tard will finance the acquisition, which includes 225 full-service stations, 75 automated fuel stations and 15 truck stops, from available cash and existing credit facilities. The aviation segment operates out of seven Danish airports including one in Copenhagen. The deal would allow Laval, Quebec-based Couche-Tard to use the Shell brand in Denmark for up to 10 years. \"This acquisition would be a great addition to our network in Scandinavia,\" Jacob Schram, head of Couche-Tard's European operations, said in a statement. This would be Couche-Tard's first major foray into Europe since its acquisition of Statoil Fuel & Retail ASA for $2.8 billion in 2012.

Macerich also said on Tuesday it adopted a poison pill, or a shareholder rights plan, with a 10 percent trigger and changed its board structure to thwart a hostile takeover. Shares of Macerich, which received the $91 per share offer earlier this month, fell as much as 5 percent to $90.29 in early trading. Including debt, the offer was valued at $22.4 billion. \"Macerich's rejection is based on a rosy view of its future prospects,\" Simon Property Chief Executive David Simon said in a statement, calling the rejection an \"extreme, scorched-earth response\". Macerich's directors will now be divided into three classes and their term will be three years, the company said, adding that it would review this structure in 2016. Macerich is incorporated in Maryland, which allows a company's board to take steps to ward off a hostile takeover without having to seek shareholder approval. The company said it rejected the offer partly due to antitrust concerns and its inability to evaluate Simon Property's \"claims regarding its margins.\" \"Simon's next step is likely to be to raise its offer,\" Cowen & Company analyst James Sullivan wrote in a note. Macerich has been selling off underperforming malls to focus on redeveloping its more lucrative malls. It plans to spend $400 million-$500 million annually on such actions over the next five years. The deal would have helped Simon Property boost its portfolio of high-end malls, which are performing better than those with mid-range brands, and expand in California and other western states. High-end malls generally house expensive brands such as Apple Inc and Macy Inc's Bloomingdale's. Macerich said its rights plan, which came into effect immediately, would expire on the date of its 2016 annual investor meeting. Shareholders of record as on March 30 will have the right to buy one preferred share for each common share held. Deutsche Bank Securities Inc, Goldman Sachs & Co and JP Morgan Securities LLC are Macerich's financial advisers, while Kirkland & Ellis LLP, Goodwin Procter LLP and Venable LLP are its legal advisers. Macerich's shares were down 3 percent at $91.86 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Simon Property's shares were little changed at $185.95.

      "articleBody": "SAN FRANCISCO, March 17 (Reuters) - Google Inc is tightening supervision of its freewheeling Play store, forming a special team to screen new apps for malware and sexually explicit material, and strengthening its age-based rating system. The change brings Google Play, a bazaar for digital games, social media apps and entertainment software, closer to Apple Inc's tightly controlled App Store. But Google is not adopting Apple's practice of only approving apps that meet its stringent quality standards. The change underscores the growing importance of apps in the success of the companies' rival mobile gadgets. Google, whose Android software runs most of the world's smartphones, and the iPhone and iPad maker each manage online hubs with more than one million apps ranging from calendars to video games. Google said in its official blog on Tuesday that its expert team will screen each app submitted by developers to spot earlier anything that runs afoul of its rules. Google had only used automated technology for screening at the time of submission. The new process will not create bottlenecks, Google said in a post, promising that approved apps will become available on Google Play within \"a matter of hours\" after submission. Apple does not disclose its app review period, but the website appreviewtimes.com puts the average wait time at seven days for Apple's App Store. Developers must answer special questionnaires about their apps to help independent ratings organizations assign age-based ratings, Google said. \"We know that people in different countries have different ideas about what content is appropriate for kids, teens and adults, so today's announcement will help developers better label their apps for the right audience,\" Google said in the blog post. As of May, apps submitted without the questionnaire will not be published in Google Play, and existing apps that do not seek a rating could be blocked in certain markets or for certain users, Google said. Until now, Google has let developers rate their own apps using a system created by Google.

      "articleBody": "DETROIT, March 17 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co is turning to one of its early technology partners, Microsoft Corp , to help expand the automaker's connected car services. Among the features that Ford plans to offer later this year through its new Service Delivery Network is the ability to automatically update its new Sync 3 infotainment system wirelessly. The service will run on Microsoft's cloud-based Azure platform. Ford's cloud-based service will enable the company to gather more data about how owners use their vehicles, according to Don Butler, executive director of connected vehicle and services. That data, Butler said, \"will increase our ability to understand the user experience inside the vehicle . . . with the informed permission of customers.\" Butler said the vehicle data that Ford acquires wirelessly through the cloud could be used to remotely diagnose mechanical problems or alert owners and dealers on scheduled maintenance. It could also provide insurers with information about vehicle usage and owners' driving habits. Ford two years ago shifted from Microsoft to BlackBerry Ltd's QNX to help it develop the software for Sync 3, after earlier versions of Sync and MyFord Touch, jointly developed with Microsoft, were troubled by technical glitches and widespread consumer complaints. The Sync 3 system, unveiled last December, will begin appearing this fall on some 2016 Ford models. Ford's cloud network also will enable the company to integrate a broader array of mobile services both inside and away from the vehicle, Butler said. Where manufacturers in the past received much of their revenue from the sale or lease of vehicles, a rapidly evolving business model that encompasses such services as car sharing and pay-per-use rentals has expanded the definition of mobility, Butler said. \"There will be revenues associated with that,\" he said, adding that third-party developers \"may come up with new ways to leverage the data and create new opportunities to deliver services\" to vehicle users. Butler declined to say whether Ford is developing a concierge/communication service similar to General Motors Co's OnStar. But he said Ford's new partnership with Microsoft \"positions us to be able to deliver a broad set of connectivity-related services.\" Ford is not the first automaker to use the Azure platform. Four years ago, Microsoft and Toyota Motor Corp announced a cloud-services partnership around Azure. And in 2013, a similar deal was struck with Qoros, a unit of China's Chery Automobile Co.

      "articleBody": "* Company developing drug as additional therapy to statins * Says will look for partner to commercialize drug outside US * Shares rise as much as 19 pct, touch record high (Adds analyst comment, background; updates shares) By Amrutha Penumudi and Rosmi Shaji March 17 (Reuters) - Esperion Therapeutics Inc said its experimental drug lowered LDL or \"bad\" cholesterol levels in patients who were already on statins, the current standard of care. Esperion's shares rose 19 percent to a record high of $91.50 on the Nasdaq. The company has been developing ETC-1002 as an additional therapy to statins or as an option for patients who are intolerant to statins. Statins have been the preferred first-line treatment for cholesterol for decades and many of them have gone generic. Needham & Co analyst Chad Messer said he expects the drug to be adopted faster as an additional therapy to statins rather than replacing statins altogether. There are about 35 million patients who take statins in the United States. Out of these, 30 percent still have cholesterol levels that are too high, Messer said. \"That is about 10 million patients, which is a huge market potential.\" Messer said he expects sales of about $1.22 billion from ETC-1002 as an additional therapy to statins by 2025. He expects sales of $1.65 billion from patients unable to tolerate statin drugs. Esperion announced results from another mid-stage trial in October, where the same drug lowered LDL levels significantly than Merck & Co Inc's Zetia. Zetia's 2014 sales worldwide were about $2.7 billion. ETC-1002 is the first in a new class of drugs called ACL inhibitors that work by reducing cholesterol synthesis in the liver and increasing occurrence of LDL receptors that remove cholesterol from the blood. Patients taking doses of 120 mg and 180 mg of the drug showed 17 percent and 24 percent greater reduction in LDL cholesterol levels than a placebo. The LDL-lowering power of the drug is about half that of the new injectable biotech cholesterol drugs, called PCSK9 inhibitors. Compared with PCSK9 drugs, ETC-1002 is not only cheaper but also more convenient for patients, Messer said. \"It is not a shot, so for your average patient ETC-1002 is an easy oral therapy,\" he said. \"Only patients with severe cholesterol problems will take a shot and an expensive one at that.\" Shares of Esperion, which said it would want a partner to commercialize the drug outside the United States, were up 16.3 percent at $89.88. About 2.9 million shares were traded by 12:15 p.m ET, more than five times the stock's 10-day moving average. (Reporting by Amrutha Penumudi in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)"

      "articleBody": "* Sberbank, Santander, BBVA set up $100 mln fintech funds * Banks step up investments, partnerships with tech start-ups * Digital age could see 30 pct of bank revenues \"in play\" * Digital could cut 25 pct of bank costs -McKinsey * Tech seen as chance for banks to improve soiled image By Steve Slater LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - Hoping to link with tech entrepreneurs and get ahead of a wave of digital innovation, Europe's top banks are setting up multi-million dollar investment funds, hiring scouts in Silicon Valley and hosting \"speed dating\" sessions. Financial technology, or fintech, is shaking up the sector, allowing savers and borrowers to bypass traditional banks with smartphone apps and websites for loans, payments and all areas of financial services. The changes will be profound. Consultancy McKinsey said the shift to digital could see more than 30 percent of European banks' revenues up for grabs as customers shop around for online deals, while banks could cut a quarter of their costs. Getting digital right was a \"do or die challenge\", McKinsey said, while banks also see technology as a way to reconnect with customers and improve their image after years of scandals. \"For the last five years the industry has tended to communicate strategy through the rear-view mirror,\" said Kevin Hanley, responsible for strategy, architecture and data within operations and IT at Royal Bank of Scotland. \"We are now starting to lift our heads up, look out of the windscreen and talk about where we want to go,\" Hanley said. \"It's a much more forward-looking story that is centered on the customer and enabled by technology.\" To meet and feed off the fintech challenge, banks are buying into or partnering with start-ups as well as developing ideas in-house. \"All of them are now doing many things to build a wider ecosystem to help them reinvent their business models,\" said Richard Lumb, head of the financial services group at consultancy Accenture. Many banks are buying minority stakes in start-ups, giving them financial support and advice and in return get to roll out new ideas to their customers. INNOVATION PROJECTS Spain's Santander and BBVA, and Russia's Sberbank, for instance have each set up funds to invest about $100 million in fintech firms, while HSBC has an investment team that could spend even more on innovation projects. All say those amounts are flexible. Sberbank said its fund, Silicon Valley-based SBT Venture Capital, could swell to $700 million, and is only one element of a strategy that also includes in-house development and partnerships. SBT Venture Capital has invested about $50 million in less than 18 months in companies including Moven, which allows customers to track spending on a mobile, and NetGuardians, which uses behavioral analysis to monitor risks in a bank's operations. Whether banks can avoid being outflanked by the wave of innovations remains to be seen, given the speed at which fintech is overhauling how people manage their money, threatening banks' dominance in lending and payments. Peer-to-peer lending sites are linking lenders and borrowers, spearheaded by San Francisco-based Lending Club and European rivals like Zopa; payment is being shaken up by the likes of TransferWise, a UK start-up offering a low-cost way of sending money around the world. And customers have a dizzying array of financial apps like Osper, which allows teenagers to manage spending, and Acorns, a digital piggy-bank that hoovers up \"loose change\" from an electronic purchase and stores it in a savings account. SCOUTING NETWORKS No wonder then that banks are trying to ride the same bandwagon via ideas that could improve their own offerings, such as replacing identification numbers and passwords with fingerprints, and looking to firms such as Norway's Zwipe, which signed on with MasterCard for a payment card that uses fingerprint technology for authentication. European banks are also building out their scouting networks to spot targets. While London has become Europe's fintech hub and is growing fast, RBS is not alone in putting a small scouting team in Silicon Valley, which lured around a third of fintech investment in 2013, far above the 13 percent invested in Europe, according to Accenture. So-called \"accelerator programmes\" which involve banks paying for office space and offering advice to fintech companies in return for hearing their pitches in a series of \"speed dating\" sessions are proving popular. Seven firms picked for this year's Fintech Innovation Lab in London are visiting HSBC, Intesa Sanpaolo, JPMorgan and more than a dozen others, perhaps pitching to up to 70 bankers in an intensive two-hour rotation across business areas. \"It helps us bridge the gap by actually speaking to the practitioners and refining the technology and proposition,\" said Joshua Wallace, co-founder of Cytora, set up two years ago in the English university city of Cambridge to analyse social media and give early warning of geopolitical risks. Banks are still spending tens of millions of euros on their own development teams, but want to make them more nimble. Barclays, whose Chief Executive Antony Jenkins has hailed a technological revolution that will transform banking, has set up about 40 units dubbed \"hoppers\" to develop ideas more quickly. \"We needed to change the way we worked,\" said Derek White, Barclays' chief design officer. \"We needed to act like a start-up.\" (Editing by David Holmes)"

Paulo reported on Monday. Folha, which did not say how it obtained the information, said that Rio de Janeiro-based Petrobras, as the company is known, put those assets on the block as fallout from a massive corruption scandal curbed access to capital market funding. According to the paper, Petrobras hired Bradesco BBI to help manage the sale of a stake in Petrobras Distribuidora, the owner of more than 7,500 gasoline stations in the country. The size of that stake is yet to be defined, the paper added. Itaú BBA was hired to help Petrobras fully or partially exit the natural gas distribution sector, Folha said, adding that the divestment of 21 thermal electricity plants will be handled by Bradesco BBI. Likewise, Itaú BBA won a mandate to coordinate the sale of hundreds of gasoline stations that Petrobras owns in Argentina, Colombia, Paraguay and Uruguay, the paper said. Potential sales of stakes in some oil fields are being considered, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch among candidates for the mandate, Folha said. Itaú BBA and Bradesco BBI are the wholesale and investment-banking units of Brazil's two largest private-sector lenders, Itaú Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Bradesco SA. Petrobras did not immediately respond to calls or messages seeking comment on the Folha report. Reuters reported last month that JPMorgan Chase & Co landed one of the mandates.

On an adjusted basis, the company reported a quarterly loss of 8 cents per share for the quarter ended Dec. 31, bigger than average estimate of a 4 cents loss. Cost of product revenue jumped 71 percent to $10.4 million. The company reiterated its 2015 sales forecast of at least $100 million. Analysts on average were expecting $107.1 million. Net loss attributable to common shareholders narrowed to $7.2 million, or 4 cents per share, from $28.9 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier when it recorded a $21 million charge related to stock warrants. The company recorded a $6.1 million gain related to stock warrants in the latest reported quarter. (Reporting by Sneha Banerjee and Anannya Pramanick in Bengaluru; Editing by Don Sebastian)"

      "articleBody": "* FTSEurofirst 300 down 0.9 pct, below 7-1/2 year high * Peugeot falls as car sales growth lower than sector * DAX underperform as ZEW survey lower than expected By Atul Prakash LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - European shares retreated from a 7-1/2-year high on Tuesday, with PSA Peugeot Citroen leading automakers lower after the release of car sales data and a German economic sentiment survey coming in below expectations. Germany's DAX, down 1.6 percent, underperformed the broader market after hitting a new record high in the previous session. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index index was down 0.9 percent at 1,580.58 points at 1129 GMT after hitting a 7-1/2-year high of 1,598.03 earlier in the session. The STOXX Europe Automobiles and Parts index fell 2.7 percent, the top sectoral decliner, dragged down by a 7.8 percent fall in Peugeot after the automaker's vehicle sales rose less than the sector in February. \"The new car sales from Peugeot are disappointing. Peugeot underperformed the European auto market in February with an increase limited at 1.1 percent,\" a Paris-based trader said. Data from the Association of European Carmakers (ACEA) showed new car registrations in Europe rose 7 percent in the month of February, fuelled by double-digit sales growth in Italy and Spain. The European stock market saw further selling pressure after the Mannheim-based think tank ZEW said its monthly survey of economic sentiment increased to 54.8 in March from 53.0 in February. This was below a Reuters consensus forecast of 58.2. ZEW warned a lack of progress in the Greek and Ukraine crises was dampening sentiment. However, analysts stayed positive on the market's longer-term outlook. The FTSEurofirst 300 index has risen more than 15 percent so far this year as bond purchases from the European Central Banks drove yields on government debt to record lows, leading investors to seek higher returns in equities. \"European assets are in a powerful catch-up rally, which is not over,\" said Pascal Blanque, chief investment officer at Amundi, which has 850 billion euros ($902 billion) in assets under management. \"With the euro falling, the QE (quantitative easing) starting, the recent improvement in macro indicators, European assets are in a sweet spot. It could last for a while, as long as global growth remains above 3 percent.\" Greek banks rose 3.8 percent, helped by a 6.9 percent gain in Bank of Piraeus and a 4.6 percent stronger Alpha Bank on expectations that the Greek debt crisis will eventually get resolved. A Greek government official said on Tuesday that Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has asked for a meeting with top European policymakers including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi on the sidelines of an EU summit this week.

      "articleBody": "(Adds details) MOSCOW, March 17 (Reuters) - Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak plans to meet Exxon's chief executive officer, Rex Tillerson, on Wednesday, a ministry official told Reuters. The official declined to give any more details for the meeting, which comes as Western sanctions, imposed on Russia over its actions in Ukraine, have prevented the U.S. company from participating in several projects in Russia. Tillerson last visited Moscow in June 2014 when he affirmed his commitment to doing business with Russia. Last year, Exxon was forced by the sanctions to suspend its joint operations with Russia's top oil producer Rosneft in the offshore Arctic, where they successfully performed exploration drilling. A Rosneft spokeswoman declined to comment on any possible meeting of Tillerson and Rosneft's head, Igor Sechin. The sanctions prevent Western companies from giving Russia technology for Arctic offshore, deepwater and shale oil development. Rosneft will not resume drilling in the Arctic Kara Sea this year because of the sanctions. Exxon has also been involved in a joint oil and gas project with Rosneft, Sakhalin-1, which produces over 100,000 barrels per day of oil. Sakhalin-1 is not subject to the sanctions.

      "articleBody": "WASHINGTON, March 17 (Reuters) - Top executives of U.S. and Gulf airlines will take their dispute over whether \"open skies\" deals have led to unfair competition to a high-profile public forum in Washington on Tuesday as each side ramps up efforts to sway U.S. regulators. Three U.S. airlines have accused their competitors from the Gulf of receiving more than $40 billion in government subsidies, and have called on the White House to address the claims in talks on \"Open Skies\" with Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Emirates Airline, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways have denied the allegations, saying U.S. airlines have lost market share because of their inferior service. The Obama administration has said in statements that it takes the competition concerns of the U.S. airlines seriously, but remains \"committed to the Open Skies policy which has greatly benefitted the traveling public, the U.S. aviation industry...and the broader U.S. economy.\" Airline industry executives are expected to address the dispute on Tuesady at a conference sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Etihad's Chief Executive Officer James Hogan will kick off the debate with a speech at 9:50 a.m. EDT (1350 GMT), following a speech by Carsten Spohr, chief executive officer of Lufthansa Group. In the meantime, the U.S. and Gulf airlines have assembled teams of high-profile Washington insiders to help argue their case. Working for the Partnership for Open & Fair Skies, a coalition of Delta Air Lines Inc, United Continental Holdings Inc, American Airlines Group Inc and their labor unions, are legal counsel from WilmerHale with extensive experience in trade negotiation and a former director of public affairs at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Lobbying for Emirates is John Byerly, a former deputy assistant secretary for transportation affairs in the U.S. Department of State, according to a publicly filed disclosure. As the sides jostle for U.S. regulators' favor, a development in Europe may have added to the pressure that the Gulf carriers face as well. The European Commission said last week that it will address French and German concerns over the alleged subsidies when it proposes a commercial aviation agreement with the Gulf region later this year.

      "articleBody": "LJUBLJANA, March 17 (Reuters) - Slovenia is committed to selling state-owned companies as it is the only way to create new jobs, its finance minister and central bank governor told a business conference on Tuesday, after years of stalling on privatisation. Figures show that Slovenia's state-owned firms have significantly lower profits than privately owned companies and invest less, a problem compounded by public spending cuts over the past year as the government tries to bring down the deficit. \"The key question is whether a company can create new jobs. Many state companies cannot do that,\" Bank of Slovenia governor Bostjan Jazbec, who also sits on the European Central Bank's governing council, said. Successive governments in Slovenia, which broke away from the former Yugoslavia in 1991, have refused to sell major banks and companies so the government still controls about 50 percent of the economy and as much as 60 percent of the banking sector. But Finance Minister Dusan Mramor told delegates at the conference in Ljubljana that the centre-left government, in office since September, would press on with a privatisation drive started in 2013. Mramor said the government would draft a long-term privatisation strategy by the end of April. Asked whether the government was committed to privatisation, he said, \"Definitely.\" Slovenia returned to economic growth last year after dipping in and out of recession for years, a downturn which has exposed corruption and cronyism across most of its industries. Unemployment reached 13.5 percent in January, the statistics office reported on Tuesday, up from 13 percent in December. Jazbec said the banking sector would have to consolidate due to tougher competition across the European Union. The Slovenian government poured some 3.5 billion euros ($3.7 billion) into banks in 2013 and 2014, which helped the country narrowly avoid an international bailout. Mramor said the government had promised the European Commission it would over time sell all the state-owned banks that had received state help apart from the largest bank, NLB. In the next few weeks, Slovenia hopes to sell the second largest bank Nova KBM (NKBM), one of the lenders that received state help, and to merge state-owned Abanka Vipa and Banka Celje before selling the merged group within the next few years.

      "articleBody": "MUNICH, Germany, March 17 (Reuters) - German industrial group Siemens is not discussing a joint venture in trains with French peer Alstom, its chief executive Joe Kaeser said. Kaeser had told French daily Le Figaro earlier this month that a consolidation between European transport companies was still possible. Asked on Tuesday whether there were any talks with Alstom, Kaeser told Reuters on the fringes of a management conference in Munich: \"There haven't been any for a year. And so there are no grounds for speculation.\" Siemens lost out to arch-rival General Electric in a battle to buy Alstom's energy assets last year. It had hoped for a while afterwards to combine its rail assets, which include trains, trams and signaling technology, with those of Alstom. Since then, the rail industry has continued to consolidate in the face of increasingly fierce competition. China's CNR and rival CSR Corp plan to merge to create a $26 billion company, the world's largest trainmaker by sales thanks to its domestic market, which is looking to export markets for its high-speed trains. And last month, Italian aerospace and defence group Finmeccanica agreed to sell its rail business to Hitachi Ltd in a deal worth up to 1.9 billion euros ($2.2 billion). Asked whether consolidation would continue, Kaeser replied: \"I can't say. We are very strongly positioned ... I believe we have all the possibilities to be successful by ourselves. We must of course execute cleanly.\" (Editing by David Holmes)"
